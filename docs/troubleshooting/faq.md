### How do I create my first story?

1. **Start simple**: Open Story Mode and create a new story
2. **Write an opening**: Type a few sentences to establish setting and character
3. **Use AI continuation**: Press the continue button to see how AI extends your story
4. **Ask the Oracle**: When facing decisions, ask yes/no questions to guide the plot
5. **Build as you go**: Add characters and locations to your repository as they appear

## Features and Functionality

### How does the Oracle system work?

The Oracle answers yes/no questions about your story using a weighted probability system:

- **20% chance**: "Yes" (simple positive)
- **60% chance**: "Yes, but" (positive with complications)
- **10% chance**: "No, but" (negative with silver lining)
- **5% chance**: "Yes, and" (strongly positive)
- **5% chance**: "No, and" (strongly negative)

Each response includes keywords and AI interpretation to help guide your story.

### Why does the Oracle favor "Yes, but" results?

"Yes, but" results create the most interesting storytelling opportunities by:
- Moving the plot forward (the "Yes" part)
- Adding complications that create tension (the "But" part)
- Generating unexpected twists and character development
- Keeping stories dynamic and engaging

### How can I get better AI continuations?

1. **Provide clear context**: End sentences with clear direction for what happens next
2. **Use repository items**: Reference characters and locations by name for consistency
3. **Adjust settings**: Experiment with temperature and other AI parameters
4. **Edit freely**: Treat AI output as a first draft that you can modify
5. **Give feedback**: The more you edit AI output, the better it learns your style

### What are Spark Tables and how do I use them?

Spark Tables generate random keywords for creative inspiration:

- **Default sparks**: General-purpose keywords for any genre
- **Themed sparks**: Genre-specific keywords (horror, fantasy, sci-fi, etc.)
- **Custom sparks**: Your own keyword collections

Use sparks when you're stuck, need plot direction, or want to add unexpected elements to your story.

### How do I organize my characters and locations?

Use the Repository system to store story elements:

1. **Create repository items** for characters, locations, objects, and situations
2. **Include keywords** that trigger automatic inclusion in AI context
3. **Add relevant details** that help maintain story consistency
4. **Organize by scope**: Library-wide, shelf-specific, book-specific, or chapter-specific
5. **Reference by name** in your writing to automatically include their information
