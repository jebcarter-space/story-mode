## ðŸ“± Web App vs VSCode Extension

Story Mode offers two complementary interfaces:

### VSCode Extension
Perfect for developers and writers who live in VS Code:
- Inline AI continuation with **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**
- Integrated Oracle queries with **Ctrl+Shift+O**
- File-based workflow with Git integration
- Advanced template system with multi-LLM routing

### Web Application
Ideal for pure storytelling and gaming:
- Clean, distraction-free interface
- Visual spark table management
- Repository browser and editor
- Mobile-friendly design

Both share the same file format and can work with the same `.story-mode` directories!
