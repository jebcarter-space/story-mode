# The Dark Beginning

The room was cold, a stark contrast to the sweltering heat outside. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight filtering through a high, narrow window, but otherwise the space was shrouded in gloom. The air smelled faintly of old parchment and something else—something metallic, almost medicinal.

A single desk stood in the center, its surface covered with papers and an open leather-bound book. Behind it, leaning back in an ornate wooden chair, sat a man in his late thirties. His dark eyes flickered up as the door creaked open, but his face remained impassive, giving away nothing.

"Close the door," he said, voice deep and measured.

You stepped inside and did as instructed. The heavy oak door thudded shut behind you, sealing away the sounds of the city beyond. As your eyes adjusted to the dim light, you saw him more clearly. His hair was dark and neatly groomed, his clothes expensive.



**Oracle:** What does he offer me?
**Answer:** Yes, and... *(20)*

The man's fingers drummed once against the worn leather of the desk before he leaned forward slightly, his eyes fixed intently on you.

"Sit," he said, gesturing to the chair opposite him. His tone was not unkind, but there was a firmness to it, a quiet authority that suggested he was accustomed to being obeyed. His gaze lingered on you, appraising, as you pulled out the chair and lowered yourself into it.

He reached for a small silver case on the desk, opened it, and took out a cigarette. "You smoke?" he asked, already offering you one.

You shook your head.

He shrugged, lighting his own with a match from a brass holder. The flame briefly illuminated his sharp features—the high cheekbones, the firm line of his jaw, the slight arch of his brow as he inhaled the first drag. He exhaled slowly, watching you through the smoke.

"Good," he said finally. "I prefer not to

 deal with someone who talks too much." A ghost of a smile touched his lips as he set the cigarette in an onyx ashtray, fingers leaving a faint smudge of ash on the polished surface.

His next words came more slowly, deliberately. "I understand you're looking for something. Something... not so easily found." He leaned back again, watching you carefully. "And I understand you're not entirely certain what that is."

The atmosphere between you thickened. You felt his gaze like a weight, pressing down, testing. He was waiting—waiting for you to say something, to reveal something.

You shifted slightly in the chair. "I don't know what I'm looking for," you admitted. "But I know I need to find it."

His expression didn't change, but something in his eyes sharpened. A flicker of interest, perhaps. Or amusement. He reached for his cigarette again, took another slow drag, and then spoke again.

"Then"Then you've come to the right place," he said, the words emerging with a measured cadence. His fingers tapped once against the desk before he leaned forward slightly, his gaze fixed intently on you. "But before we go any further, you need to understand what you're stepping into."

He reached for a small leather-bound book from the stack on his desk, flipping it open with practiced ease. The pages were thick, the handwriting inside a precise, flowing script. He turned it toward you, showing you a passage underlined in dark ink.

"Read," he said simply.

Your eyes scanned the words. They were dense, the sentences winding together like a puzzle, but the meaning was clear: a warning, a promise. It spoke of truths buried deep, of doors that should not be opened, of knowledge that could remake a man—or unmake him entirely.

You lifted your gaze to meet his. He had not moved, his face still carefully neutral, but

his eyes held something darker now—something knowing. "You understand," he said quietly, almost testing the words himself as he spoke them. "You understand what this means."

You nodded slowly. "I think so."

His lips curled into something that was not quite a smile. "Then you understand why I don't waste time with idle talk." He closed the book with a soft thud and leaned back again, studying you with an almost clinical interest. "You're here because you're looking for something dangerous. Something... twisted."

The word hung between you, heavy with implication.

"But," he continued, voice dropping lower, "I think you already suspected that. Didn't you?"

You didn't answer immediately. Instead, you let the silence stretch between you, feeling his gaze press down on you like a weight. The air in the room seemed to grow stiller, as if the very walls were holding their breath.

Finally, you nodded. "Yes."

His face did not change, but something flickered across his features—approval, perhaps. Or satisfaction. He nodded once, as if confirming something to himself, and leaned forward again.

"Good," he said softly. "Then let's begin."

He reached for his cigarette again, took a long drag, and exhaled slowly. The smoke curled between you like a living thing, thick and heavy in the still air.

"You're not the first to come here looking for answers," he said. "But you are the first in a long time to admit what you're really seeking." His fingers traced the edge of the ashtray, leaving another smudge of ash. "That tells me something about you."

You waited, feeling the weight of his words, the significance of his gaze.

"You're strong," he continued. "Not just physically—though I suspect you are that too—but mentally. You didn't flinch when I showed you that passage. You didn't recoil when I called what you seek

"twisted." He leaned forward slightly, his fingers drumming once against the desk. "That means you're ready to face what you find."

A long pause stretched between you. You could hear the distant hum of the street outside, the creak of old wood as someone moved in another room. But in here, it was silent.

He leaned back again, stretching his legs out slightly. "I could tell you what you want to know. But I think you already know the kind of knowledge I deal in. You wouldn't be here if you didn't."

You nodded. "I wouldn't."

His lips curled slightly, but it wasn't quite a smile. "Then I won't waste your time with pleasantries." He reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a small glass bottle stoppered with dark wax. Inside, something thick and viscous sloshed—a dark liquid, almost black in the dim light. He held it up between you, turning it slightly so the dim**Sparks:** Fluttering, Performance, Fair

light caught the edges. "This is what you came for."

You stared at it, feeling a strange pull deep in your chest. It was beautiful in a way, like a piece of art—except that you knew better. This was no simple object.

"You want to know what it does," he said, not a question. He set it down between you carefully, as if handling something fragile. "But I think you already have some idea."

You did. The book had hinted at it, the way he spoke of it, the way the air in the room seemed to tighten when he placed it on the desk. This wasn't just some potion or poison. This was something else entirely.

You swallowed, speaking quietly. "It changes people."

His eyes flickered with something unreadable. "It does."

You let that settle between you, the quiet acknowledgment of what neither of you needed to say aloud. This wasn't just a drink. This was a  threshold. A choice. A transformation.

"You're hesitating," he observed, voice smooth and knowing. His fingers drummed once against the desk again, a slow, rhythmic sound in the quiet. "That's good."

You weren't sure if he meant that sincerely or not. It didn't matter. "I need to know what it does," you said, still watching the dark liquid swirl slightly inside the bottle.

He shrugged, almost lazily. "It rewrites you. Changes you from the inside out. Turns you into something else."

Your fingers twitched slightly. "And that's a good thing?"

He laughed then—a short, dry sound, devoid of real humor. "That depends on what you want."

You met his gaze, steady despite the unease curling in your stomach. "I want to understand."

His face remained impassive, but something in his eyes sharpened. "Then understand this," he said, voice dropping lower. "Itthreshold. A crossing. A door to something else.

You reached out, fingers hovering just above the glass. Not touching. Not yet.

"And once it's inside you," he said, voice even, "you don't come back."

You looked up at him. His face was impassive, but there was something in his tone—a warning, maybe. Or a challenge.

You exhaled slowly. "I know."

His fingers tapped once against the desk. "You do."

Another silence. The smoke had thinned between you now, almost dissipated, but the air still felt heavy, charged.

He leaned back slightly, resting an elbow on the arm of his chair. "You're hesitating."

You weren't sure if it was a question or an observation. Either way, it was true. Your fingers were still hovering, not quite touching the bottle.

"Not hesitation," you said finally. "Consideration."

He hummed in his throat, as if weighing that. "That # {{sparks:gothic-atmosphere,steampunk-elements:1}} Scene

... is a careful distinction," he said. "And a dangerous one."

You nodded slowly, fingers finally closing around the bottle. The glass was cool against your palm, but the liquid inside—black as ink, thick as oil—seemed to pulse slightly, shifting in some way that wasn't quite natural.

You unscrewed the cap, the faint click echoing in the silence between you. The smell hit you then—metallic and sweet, like blood mixed with honey. It made your stomach tighten.

"You don't have to," he said, but he didn't stop you.

You didn't look at him as you brought the bottle to your lips. The first sip burned, like swallowing fire, and you knew instantly—this wasn't alcohol. This was something else entirely.

You swallowed again, bracing for the change, for the thing inside you to take hold. A slow heat spread through your veins, tendrils of it curling outward from your core. Your vision
