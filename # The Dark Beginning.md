# The Dark Beginning

The room was cold, a stark contrast to the sweltering heat outside. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight filtering through a high, narrow window, but otherwise the space was shrouded in gloom. The air smelled faintly of old parchment and something else—something metallic, almost medicinal.

A single desk stood in the center, its surface covered with papers and an open leather-bound book. Behind it, leaning back in an ornate wooden chair, sat a man in his late thirties. His dark eyes flickered up as the door creaked open, but his face remained impassive, giving away nothing.

"Close the door," he said, voice deep and measured.

You stepped inside and did as instructed. The heavy oak door thudded shut behind you, sealing away the sounds of the city beyond. As your eyes adjusted to the dim light, you saw him more clearly. His hair was dark and neatly groomed, his clothes expensive.



**Oracle:** What does he offer me?
**Answer:** Yes, and... *(20)*

The man's fingers drummed once against the worn leather of the desk before he leaned forward slightly, his eyes fixed intently on you.

"Sit," he said, gesturing to the chair opposite him. His tone was not unkind, but there was a firmness to it, a quiet authority that suggested he was accustomed to being obeyed. His gaze lingered on you, appraising, as you pulled out the chair and lowered yourself into it.

He reached for a small silver case on the desk, opened it, and took out a cigarette. "You smoke?" he asked, already offering you one.

You shook your head.

He shrugged, lighting his own with a match from a brass holder. The flame briefly illuminated his sharp features—the high cheekbones, the firm line of his jaw, the slight arch of his brow as he inhaled the first drag. He exhaled slowly, watching you through the smoke.

"Good," he said finally. "I prefer not to

 deal with someone who talks too much." A ghost of a smile touched his lips as he set the cigarette in an onyx ashtray, fingers leaving a faint smudge of ash on the polished surface.

His next words came more slowly, deliberately. "I understand you're looking for something. Something... not so easily found." He leaned back again, watching you carefully. "And I understand you're not entirely certain what that is."

The atmosphere between you thickened. You felt his gaze like a weight, pressing down, testing. He was waiting—waiting for you to say something, to reveal something.

You shifted slightly in the chair. "I don't know what I'm looking for," you admitted. "But I know I need to find it."

His expression didn't change, but something in his eyes sharpened. A flicker of interest, perhaps. Or amusement. He reached for his cigarette again, took another slow drag, and then spoke again.

"Then"Then you've come to the right place," he said, the words emerging with a measured cadence. His fingers tapped once against the desk before he leaned forward slightly, his gaze fixed intently on you. "But before we go any further, you need to understand what you're stepping into."

He reached for a small leather-bound book from the stack on his desk, flipping it open with practiced ease. The pages were thick, the handwriting inside a precise, flowing script. He turned it toward you, showing you a passage underlined in dark ink.

"Read," he said simply.

Your eyes scanned the words. They were dense, the sentences winding together like a puzzle, but the meaning was clear: a warning, a promise. It spoke of truths buried deep, of doors that should not be opened, of knowledge that could remake a man—or unmake him entirely.

You lifted your gaze to meet his. He had not moved, his face still carefully neutral, but
