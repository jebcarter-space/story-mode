# The Soft Demise

Emily slipped into the alleyway near her apartment, the brickwork cool with the evening's sea air. She could
**Sparks:** Rambling, cautious, Carry
The alleyway was narrow, its walls looming above her like the dark insides of a throat. Emily's fingers traced the rough brick as she walked, each step careful and quiet. The distant sounds of the city—car horns, laughter, a siren wailing—felt muted, as if heard through a thick wall.

She paused when she reached the middle of the passage. Ahead, the dim glow of a streetlamp cast elongated shadows across the pavement. A man stood beneath it, his back to her, shoulders hunched. He was taller than most, with a broad frame that made the narrow space feel even more constricted.

Emily didn't recognize him. That wasn't unusual—she knew few people in this city. But something about the way he stood, still as a statue, made her hesitate. He wasn't moving, wasn't shifting his weight. He could have been carved from stone.

Her throat tightened. She could retreat. She could turn and walk away.

**Oracle:** Does the man attack Emily? Is it even a man?
**Answer:** Yes *(16)*
**Keywords:** Damage, Express
**Interpretation:** The answer is yes, guided by Damage forces through Express means.

Emily hesitated, her fingers curling into the rough brick at her back. The man didn't move. He didn't breathe. His shoulders remained squared, his head tilted slightly down, as if he were staring at something just beyond her line of sight.

She should leave.

But her feet stayed rooted in place, her chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. The alley was too narrow to slip past him. She could try to run—but he was between her and the street. And Emily had lived in cities long enough to know: hesitation was as dangerous as fear.

Then he turned.

Slowly. Deliberately.

His face was obscured by shadow, but his eyes—two dark pits beneath the brim of a low-slung cap—caught the dim light. They weren't human. They weren't looking at her. They were through her.

Emily's stomach lurched. She opened her mouth to speak, but no words came out.

He stepped forward.

No sound. No shift of air, no creak of leather or fabric. He was there, and then he was closer, the distance between them vanishing in a single, impossible motion.

Emily's back hit the brick wall. He was near enough now that she could see the way the shadows clung to him like smoke, the way his jacket seemed to have no seams, no edges, just a formless mass swallowing light. His head tilted slightly, his face still obscured by the cap's brim, but she could see the barest glint of something sharp beneath it.

She tried to swallow, tried to speak, but her voice was gone. Her pulse hammered in her throat.

Then his hand came up.

Slowly. Slowly.

His fingers were long, unnaturally so, stretching as he lifted his hand until they nearly brushed the side of her face. Emily flinched, pressing harder against the wall, but he didn't touch her.

Not yet.

His fingers flexed

**Oracle:** Does the creature rape her?
**Answer:** Yes, and... *(19)*
**Keywords:** Nobility, Surprise
**Interpretation:** The answer suggests Nobility influences connected to Surprise aspects.

Emily's breath caught as his fingers flexed, the tips unnaturally sharp, catching the dim light like polished steel. She could see the faintest glimmer of something inky black beneath them—something wrong. His hand hovered just inches from her face, not touching, but its presence alone was suffocating.

Her pulse thundered in her ears. Every instinct screamed to move, to run, but her body was frozen. His other hand rose, slow and deliberate, fingers flexing in the same unnatural way. Emily's breath hitched as she saw the space between his fingers elongate, stretching like liquid shadow.

The alley was suffocatingly small, the brick walls pressing in on both sides. She had nowhere to go.

Then his fingers moved.

Not toward her face. Not yet.

They curled into the air, tracing the contours of her body without touching. The sharp points hovered just above the fabric of her shirt, never breaking skin, but she could feelthe cold radiating from them. As if the very space between them had dropped ten degrees.

Emily made a sound—small, strangled. She could feel her pulse pounding in her throat, her chest rising and falling too fast. His fingers traced upward now, hovering just above the hollow of her collarbone.

He tilted his head, studying her. It wasn't curiosity. It was something worse—something calculating.

His other hand finally moved.

It came up in a slow arc, the sharp tips nearing the side of her face. She tried to turn away, but the movement was sluggish, her body still locked in place by some unseen force. His fingers brushed her cheek—not with skin, not with flesh, but with something cold and unyielding, like metal dipped in liquid shadow.

Emily's breath hitched. The touch was precise, deliberate. It wasn't pain. Not yet. But it was wrong. It was invasive in a way that made her skin crawl,  but not more than the way his other hand now settled against the front of her shirt, fingers splaying open just above her breast. The fabric didn't tear; it simply gave way beneath his touch, folding inward like paper caught in a vacuum. The cold bled through, sinking into her skin with an almost gentle persistence.

Then his fingers closed.

Not into a fist. Not yet. But there was a pressure, an unnatural force pressing against her ribcage as if testing her bones' strength. Emily let out a broken noise—half gasp, half whimper—as she felt the pressure shift, adjusting. Measuring.

His head tilted slightly. That was all. But something in the way he did it made Emily's stomach twist.

His fingers tightened.

Not crushing. Not yet. But there was a definite pressure now, a weight that made her ribs creak under the strain. The cold seeped deeper, spreading out from the point of contact like ice settling into water. Emily could feel her breath coming in shallow, strained gasps, her arms twitching weakly at her sides, useless.

His free hand lifted, fingers curling toward her face again. Then—slowly, deliberately—he traced the line of her jaw.

The touch was featherlight. Gentle, even.

Emily's vision swam.

Because the gentleness was worse.

This wasn't pain. It wasn't violence. It was something far more insidious. The kind of touch that doesn't ask—it accepts. That doesn't wait—it takes.

His fingers left the slope of her jaw and curved around the side of her neck.

Not gripping. Not yet.

But holding.

Emily's body convulsed, alThe grip on her throat was firm. Not crushing, not yet. But the way his fingers curled—long, inhuman, the cold of them seeping into her skin like ice through her veins—told her exactly what was coming. His thumb traced the line of her pulse point. She could hear her own heartbeat hammering, loud and frantic, against the walls of the alley. He must have heard it too.

Emily tried to swallow, but the grip was already there, just firm enough to make it impossible.

A slow smile—if you could call it that—spread across his face. His fingers flexed minutely, and the pressure increased just slightly. Not enough to hurt. Not yet.

And then—then—his other hand shifted.

The one resting at her collarbone. The one that had already torn through fabric like it wasn't even there.

It moved downward.

Not fast. Not rough. Not with the kind of urgency you'd expect in an alleyway r
