# The Knight's Journey

Sir Gallant stood at the edge of the Whispering Woods, his hand resting on the pommel of his ancestral sword. The dark forest stretched before him, ancient trees swaying in the evening breeze. Local villagers had warned him about entering after sunset, but the missing merchant's daughter couldn't wait until dawn.

He took a deep breath and stepped into the shadows. The canopy above blocked most of the fading light, and soon he was navigating by the eerie glow of luminescent mushrooms growing along the twisted path. Every few steps, he heard rustling in the underbrush â€“ too deliberate to be just small forest creatures.

As he rounded a bend in the path, Sir Gallant paused. The silence had become oppressive, and even the usual forest sounds had ceased. Something was watching him.
